# gearbadge

Code to display moving gears on the [Hackaday Supercon 2023](https://hackaday.com/tag/2023-hackaday-supercon/) conference badge.

More details about the badge are [here](https://hackaday.com/2023/10/18/2023-hackaday-supercon-badge-welcome-to-the-vectorscope/).

I took inspiration from the round display to display round gears, arranged as a [planetary gearset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicyclic_gearing).
The code to design the gears is adapted from this [Observable notebook](https://observablehq.com/@dkirkby/gears).
